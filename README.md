# A ChatGPT UI. Stream OpenAI responses with Langchain and Nextjs

A complete UI for an OpenAI powered Chatbot inspired by ([https://www.ai.com](https://chat.openai.com/)).

It makes use of Nextjs streaming responses from the edge. Langchain is used to manage the chat history and calls to OpenAI's chat completion. It uses a basic `BufferMemory` as Memory.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
